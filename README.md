# CourseProject 

The goal of this project is to develop a means of easily comparing various topic modeling methods, such as [LDA](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) and [Top2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09470).  
This was implemented through a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) web app hosted [here](https://share.streamlit.io/wujameszj/courseproject/main/main.py).  
A demo video is available [here]().

## Install

The online web app is limited to a small allocation of resources in terms of CPU and RAM.  
For heavy testing, it is recommended to run this app locally.
